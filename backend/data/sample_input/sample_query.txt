LEGAL CONSULTATION REQUEST

    I am writing to seek advice regarding a property dispute I'm currently involved in. My neighbor has constructed a wall that encroaches approximately 2 feet onto my property according to the land survey and property deed. The wall was constructed 3 months ago without my consent or any consultation.
    
    When I approached my neighbor about this issue, they claimed that they had been using that portion of land for over 15 years (though I've only owned the property for 5 years) and therefore had acquired rights to it. They mentioned something about "adverse possession" and "prescriptive easements" but I'm not sure if these concepts apply in this situation.
    
    I have the following questions:
    
    1. What legal rights do I have to have the encroaching wall removed?
    2. Is there any validity to my neighbor's claim of adverse possession?
    3. What documentation should I gather to support my case?
    4. What is the statute of limitations for this type of property dispute?
    
    I would appreciate any guidance or references to relevant legal precedents that might apply to my situation.
    
    Thank you for your assistance.
    
    Sincerely,
    James Wilson
