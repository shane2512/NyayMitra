You are a contract negotiation expert. Based on the following risk analysis, provide a detailed negotiation simulation and improvement strategy.

CONTRACT ANALYSIS:
- Total Clauses: {len(risk_report)}
- High Risk: {counts['High']} clauses
- Medium Risk: {counts['Medium']} clauses  
- Low Risk: {counts['Low']} clauses
- Current Safety Index: {safety_index}

HIGH RISK ISSUES:
{chr(10).join(high_risk_issues) if high_risk_issues else "None identified"}

MEDIUM RISK ISSUES:
{chr(10).join(medium_risk_issues[:5]) if medium_risk_issues else "None identified"}

Please provide:
1. A negotiation simulation showing what would happen if the high-risk clauses were renegotiated
2. Specific negotiation strategies and talking points
3. Expected outcomes and risk reduction
4. Timeline and effort required
5. Alternative approaches if negotiation fails

Format your response as a detailed simulation that shows the potential improvements and negotiation process.
