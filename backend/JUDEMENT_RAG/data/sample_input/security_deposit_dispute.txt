I'm dealing with a landlord-tenant dispute. My landlord has refused to return my security deposit claiming damages to the property, but I have photos showing the apartment was in perfect condition when I moved out. What legal recourse do I have? Is there a specific timeframe in which the landlord must return the deposit or provide an itemized statement of deductions?
