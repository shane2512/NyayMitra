I was injured in a car accident where the other driver ran a red light. I have medical bills and lost wages due to the injury. The insurance company is offering a settlement that doesn't cover all my expenses. What are my rights in this situation? Is there a statute of limitations for filing a personal injury lawsuit in cases like this?
