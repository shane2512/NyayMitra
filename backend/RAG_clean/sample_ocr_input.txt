Dear Legal Aid,

I am writing to seek advice regarding my tenancy situation in Delhi. I have been renting a flat in Rohini, Delhi for the past 3 years under a written agreement. 

Last month, my landlord suddenly increased the rent by 50%, from Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 22,500 per month without any prior notice. When I questioned this increase, he became hostile and has now given me a notice to vacate the property within 15 days.

I have always paid my rent on time and maintained the property well. I believe this sudden increase and eviction notice might not be legal. My rental agreement doesn't mention anything about such a steep increase or such a short notice period for eviction.

I would appreciate if you could advise me on what legal protections I have as a tenant under Delhi's rental laws, and what steps I should take to address this situation.

Thank you for your assistance.

Sincerely,
Raj Kumar
