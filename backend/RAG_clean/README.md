# Simplified Legal Document RAG System

This is a simplified implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for legal document analysis. It processes PDF documents and analyzes OCR text against them to find relevant legal sections.

## Implementation Note

This is a simplified version that uses basic Python functionality without requiring external ML libraries or API tokens. In a production environment, you would implement this with:

1. Real PDF processing libraries like PyPDF2 or pdfplumber
2. Proper vector embeddings using libraries like sentence-transformers
3. A vector database like FAISS or ChromaDB
4. An LLM like Gemma 2B via the Hugging Face API

## Features

- Processes legal documents (simulated PDF parsing)
- Basic keyword matching for retrieval
- Identifies relevant sections from legal texts
- Handles OCR input for analysis

## Usage

### Running the Demo

```bash
python simple_demo.py
```

This will demonstrate the RAG system with a sample query.

### Processing OCR Text

```bash
python simple_process_ocr.py sample_ocr_input.txt
```

This processes the OCR text from the specified file against the legal documents.

### Advanced Usage

You can specify which PDF documents to use:

```bash
python simple_process_ocr.py sample_ocr_input.txt --pdfs path/to/doc1.pdf path/to/doc2.pdf
```

## Implementation Details

The system works through the following steps:

1. **Document Loading**: Loads text from PDF files (simulated in this version)
2. **Text Chunking**: Splits documents into paragraphs
3. **Keyword Matching**: Finds relevant paragraphs based on keyword matching
4. **Result Generation**: Creates a structured analysis of the relevant legal sections

## Future Improvements

For a full implementation as per the original requirements, we would need to:

1. Implement proper PDF text extraction
2. Add vector embeddings for semantic search
3. Integrate with the Gemma 2B model via Hugging Face
4. Add a proper vector database for efficient retrieval
