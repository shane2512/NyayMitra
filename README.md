# NyayMitra â€“ AI-powered Legal Contract Risk Analyzer

NyayMitra is a multi-agent AI system designed to assist citizens and small businesses in understanding legal contracts without the need for a lawyer. The system leverages advanced AI technologies to analyze contract risks, summarize findings, and simulate negotiation outcomes.

## Features

- **Risk Analyzer Agent**: Breaks down contracts into clauses, identifies risks, and flags them as High, Medium, or Low with detailed explanations.
- **Summarizer Agent**: Converts technical risk assessments into plain-language summaries for easier understanding.
- **Simulation Agent**: Quantifies risk levels, calculates safety indices, and runs "what-if" scenarios to help users prepare for negotiations.
- **Moderator Agent**: Orchestrates the workflow between the Risk Analyzer, Summarizer, and Simulation agents, providing a seamless user experience.
